            Hi, I’m a junior <b>Data Scientist</b> 🧠📊 who’s seriously passionate about turning data into insights. I love running experiments on datasets (sometimes to the point of giving myself a headache 🤯 because I get that excited).
            From exploring big data and learning the latest IT tools, to analyzing complex problems and building compelling presentations 🎯—I’m all in. I'm always curious, constantly learning, and genuinely enjoy the process of uncovering patterns, building models, and telling data-driven stories.
            I’ve worked with tools like <b>Python, Jupyter Notebook, SSMS, and Power BI</b> 📈, and I’m confident in both wrangling data and presenting it in a way that makes sense to everyone—from tech teams to stakeholders. 
            Whether it’s writing clean code 👨‍💻, building dashboards 📊, or pitching ideas backed by solid data, I’m always looking to level up and make an impact through data 🚀.
            <br><br>
            👉 Feel free to explore this portfolio to see some of my work and skills in action. I hope it gives you a clear picture of what I’m capable of as a data scientist, and how passionate I am about this field!<br>
            💬 I’m always open to feedback or suggestions on my projects—after all, every comment is a chance to grow and improve!<br>
